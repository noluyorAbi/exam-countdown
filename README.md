# 🎉 Countdown App

Welcome to the Countdown App! This web application was born out of my need to keep track of important dates, like exams and deadlines, in a visually appealing and easily accessible way. Instead of hardcoding the dates in my code, I wanted to create something that anyone could use. So, here we are!

You can check out the app live [here](https://exct.vercel.app/).

## 🤔 Why I Created This App

As a student, keeping track of exam dates can be a bit stressful. I needed a simple, yet effective way to display countdowns to my exams on my MacBook screen using the [Plash](https://github.com/sindresorhus/Plash) app. Plash allows you to set any webpage as your desktop background, and I thought, why not create a customizable countdown app that fits right in?

## 🎯 Purpose

The Countdown App is designed to help you stay on top of your important dates. Whether it's exams, project deadlines, or any other events, this app will display a countdown timer for each event. It's visually intuitive, easy to use, and customizable.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Add Custom Countdowns**: Create personalized countdowns with names and specific dates.
- **Visual Indicators**:
  - Dates are highlighted in white for upcoming events.
  - They turn red when the event is less than 4 weeks away.
  - They pulse red when the event is less than 2 weeks away.
- **Shareable URLs**: Generate a unique URL to share your countdowns with others or use it with Plash.

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Visit the App**: Go to [exct.vercel.app](https://exct.vercel.app/) to start creating your countdowns.
2. **Add a Countdown**: Enter a name and date for your event and click "Add Countdown".
3. **Visualize Your Countdown**: Watch your countdown timer update in real-time. Visual cues will help you know when events are approaching.
4. **Generate a URL**: Click the "Generate URL" button to create a shareable link to your countdowns.
5. **Use with Plash**: Set the generated URL as your desktop background using the Plash app on macOS.
